# Injective TypeScript

`injective-ts` is a TypeScript monorepo that contains packages which can be used to interact with Injective from a Node.js or browser environments, as well as providing simple abstractions over core data structures, serialization, key management, API request generation, and more. The packages can be found in the `packages` folder and each package is a `npm` module that is published on the `npm` registry.
