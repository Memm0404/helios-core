# Insurance Funds

Injective enables users to build sophisticated derivatives markets on chain. An insurance fund is required for each and every derivative market in order to limit any form of socialized loss.

Any user can create an insurance fund for a derivatives market, as well as become an underwriter by adding funds to it. Based on the ownership percentage, the underwriters may receive more or less than they originally put into the fund.
