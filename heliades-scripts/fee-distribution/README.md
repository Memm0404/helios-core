# Testing the Helios Revenue and Auto-Registration Features

This directory contains scripts and instructions for testing two key features:
1. Fee Distribution (Revenue Module)
2. Automatic Contract Registration

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Install dependencies
```sh
npm install
```
- Helios local chain running
```sh
make full-install
```

# Test 1: Manual Revenue Registration and Distribution

## 1. Deploying the counter contract for revenue testing

```bash
node deploy-contract-revenue.js
```

- Expected output:
```sh

=== Deployment Script Started ===

Deployer Information:
  EVM Address (hex): 0x17267eB1FEC301848d4B5140eDDCFC48945427Ab
  Helios Address (bech32): helios1zun8av07cvqcfr2t29qwmh8ufz29gfatfue0cf
  Balance: 99.9998 HELIOS

Counter Contract Deployed!
  Contract Address: 0xB4bB7B6037DE7E8Ac7CcDEFE927ea13e94ff99d9

=== Deployment Script Completed ===
```

## 2. Add a mnemonic to the key ring

```sh
heliades keys add mykey --recover --keyring-backend=test
```
When prompted, enter the mnemonic:
```sh
web tail earth lesson domain feel slush bring amused repair lounge salt series stock fog remind ripple peace unknown sauce adjust blossom atom hotel
```
- expected output:
```sh
- address: helios1zun8av07cvqcfr2t29qwmh8ufz29gfatfue0cf
  addressEthereum: 0x17267eB1FEC301848d4B5140eDDCFC48945427Ab
  name: mykey
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/helios.crypto.v1beta1.ethsecp256k1.PubKey","key":"A+4ebHYgWYaDHGk6Ji8xp0b38a/gCCUcjHJQIzdl1ksi"}'
  type: local
```

## 3. Register the counter contract for fee distribution

- IMPORTANT: make sure to use the correct contract address, deployer address and nonce used during contract deployment.
- The contract address is `0xB4bB7B6037DE7E8Ac7CcDEFE927ea13e94ff99d9` and the deployer address is `helios1zun8av07cvqcfr2t29qwmh8ufz29gfatfue0cf` and the nonce is `1`.
  
```sh
heliades tx revenue register 0xB4bB7B6037DE7E8Ac7CcDEFE927ea13e94ff99d9 1 helios1zun8av07cvqcfr2t29qwmh8ufz29gfatfue0cf \
--from mykey \
--keyring-backend=test \
--chain-id=4242 \
--fees 250000000000000ahelios \
--gas auto \
-y
```

  
- expected output:
```sh
gas estimate: 115623
code: 0
codespace: ""
data: ""
events: []
gas_used: "0"
gas_wanted: "0"
height: "0"

txhash: 292EFB882F5279C25C774E94109502A7ABE485B922EE260450794631DDDB1D63
```

## 4. Check the contract is registered

```sh
heliades query revenue contract 0xB4bB7B6037DE7E8Ac7CcDEFE927ea13e94ff99d9
```

- expected output:
```sh
revenue:
  contract_address: 0xB4bB7B6037DE7E8Ac7CcDEFE927ea13e94ff99d9
  deployer_address: helios1zun8av07cvqcfr2t29qwmh8ufz29gfatfue0cf
  withdrawer_address: ""
```

## 5. Run the revenue distribution test script

```sh
node test-revenue.js
```

- expected output:
```sh

# Test 2: Automatic Contract Registration

## 1. Deploying a contract to test auto-registration

```bash
node deploy-contract-auto.js
```

## 2. Verify automatic registration

```sh
heliades query revenue contract <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```

- Expected output:
```sh
revenue:
  contract_address: <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
  deployer_address: <DEPLOYER_ADDRESS>
  withdrawer_address: ""
```

## 3. Run the auto-registration test script

```bash
node test-auto-registration.js
```

This script will:
1. Deploy a new contract
2. Verify it was automatically registered
3. Execute transactions to generate fees
4. Verify revenue distribution is working

For detailed events and transaction monitoring, check the logs in the terminal.
